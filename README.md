# Python Course - World 3 (Composite Structures)

This repository contains my solutions for the exercises from **World 3** of the Python course provided by [Curso em Vídeo](https://www.youtube.com/c/CursoemVídeo), taught by Professor Gustavo Guanabara.

# About the Module
**World 3** covers advanced data structures and professional programming practices. The main goal is to master how to store complex data, organize code into modules, and handle exceptions to build robust applications.

# Topics Covered:
- **Tuples:** Immutable compound variables (`()`).
- **Lists:** Mutable sequences and multidimensional lists (`[]`, `[][]`).
- **Dictionaries:** Key-Value pair data structures (`{}`).
- **Functions:** Creating custom routines (`def`), parameters, docstrings, and return values.
- **Modularization:** Organizing code into packages and modules.
- **Error Handling:** Managing exceptions with `try`, `except`, and `finally`.
